# Hordle

Hordle is a *ordle clone based primarily on [64ordle](https://64ordle.au/) and similar n-sized Wordle variants. The inspiration from building this is a combination of being too burnt out to play Wordles anymore but still finding it fun to develop one.

## Features

Current features are:
- Click to autocomplete
- On screen keyboard for mobile (needs some more work)
- Game won/over screens
- Daily new words

## Developing and running
Clone the repo, run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`

## Contributing
This project is open to contributions! Frontend is not my specialisation so anything from feature additions (pls make an issue beforehand) to bug fixes to CSS/styling and refactors is a welcome addition to the project.

### Contribution wish list
The following things would be ideal to have in this app:
- Saving game state to local storage
- Make mobile more user-friendly
- Fix appearance bugs on Safari
- Maybe a better game over screen?
- Make the autocomplete logic a bit more progressive (one missing letter but it's yellow -> can complete)
